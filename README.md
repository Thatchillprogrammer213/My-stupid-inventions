# My-stupid-inventions
The place for all of my very stupid inventions... too stupid, I guess

Also it was stupid for my things to sit here and everyone just watches... LOL ðŸ¤£

Current projects:

- ZWSPGenerator(My first one):
- - Generates *air*(the ZWSP)

- Future projects coming soon!

## Disclaimer
These are my **useless inventions**
Don't expect them to be practical(in **any** way)
They exist because I am too bored to do anything, I make them for fun
And you can fork them if you want, I have code ready for that
